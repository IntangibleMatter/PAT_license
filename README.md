# PAT_license

An MIT-like general-purpose license which disallows use as training data for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Models.

One of the most prominent debates in the creative world today is the use of works as training data for artificial intelligence. This license is my attempt at a permissive open-source general-purpose license that lets people do almost anything they want with a work... except use it as training data.

The license is as follows:
```
PAT (Permissive Anti-Training) License v1.0
Copyright (c) YYYY Full Name

This license may be included, in full or in part, in any other creative license including, but not limited to, software licenses, art licenses, font licenses, and licenses for miscellaneous written works. However, this license may not under any circumstances be separated from a work associated with it.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge to any person or persons obtaining this work and associated files to deal in the work without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the work, and to permit persons to whom the work is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

1. This work is not to be used under any circumstances as training data for any AI, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or any other form of model intended to use this data . Examples include, but are not limited to, GTP-3, Github Copilot, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion.

2. This license is included in redistributions of this work, and may apply only to this work if combined with other work. Other work may still be covered under this license, however.
